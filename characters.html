            <p>

                identity.
                At the age of eleven, Harry learns that he is a wizard and begins attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
                and Wizardry, where he discovers a place he truly belongs.throughout his years at Hogwarts, Harry forms deep
                friendships with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, faces dangerous challenges, and repeatedly comes into
                conflict with Voldemort, who seeks to regain power.

            <h2><u>Hermione Granger</u></h2>
            <p>
                Hermione Granger is one of the most important characters in the Harry Potter series, known for her
                intelligence, determination, and strong moral values. Born to non-magical parents, she enters the
                wizarding world with no prior knowledge of magic, yet quickly proves herself to be one of the brightest
                students at Hogwarts. Her love for learning, rule-following nature, and remarkable memory make her an
                exceptional witch, though she also learns that logic and books alone are not always enough.
                Throughout the series, Hermione becomes the intellectual backbone of Harry’s journey, often solving
                problems through research, critical thinking, and quick decision-making. She is fiercely loyal to her
                friends, standing by Harry and Ron even in the most dangerous situations.

            <h2><u>Ron Weasley</u></h2>
            <p>
                Ron Weasley is Harry Potter’s loyal best friend and a central figure in the wizarding trio.
                 Coming from a large, warm-hearted but financially struggling pure-blood wizarding family, Ron brings humor, honesty, and emotional grounding to their adventures.
                 Although he often struggles with insecurity and living in the shadow of his talented siblings and famous friends, Ron consistently proves his bravery and dedication.
                 His strategic thinking in wizard’s chess, deep sense of loyalty, and willingness to stand by those he cares about make him an essential part of Harry’s journey and the fight against dark forces.
